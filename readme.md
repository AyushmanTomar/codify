## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AyushmanTomar/codify.git
    cd codify
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```txt
    Flask
    Flask-SocketIO
    google-generativeai
    python-dotenv
    pywebview
    opencv-python
    mss
    numpy
    pyttsx3
    pygit2
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up API Key:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    *   Add your Google Gemini API key:
        ```env
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        # Optional: Set a default project directory
        # DEFAULT_PROJECT_DIR="/path/to/your/projects/codify_workspace"
        ```
    *   You can get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

5.  **Run the application:**
     `python app.py `

### First Launch

1.  On the first launch, if the Gemini API key isn't found in the environment, Codify might prompt you to enter it in the UI.
2.  You might be asked for a unique key for a simple login. (mail to: ayushmantomar721@gmail.com)
3.  Set your project path through the UI if it's not the default `~/codify`.

## üéÆ How to Use

*   **Project Path:** Set your working project directory via the UI. This is where Codify will manage files and run commands.
*   **API Key:** Enter your own API key to use Codify.
*   **Code Editor:** Write and modify your code. Use `Tab` for AI autocompletion.
*   **AI Analysis (Chat):**
    *   Select files you want the AI to consider.
    *   Type your request in the main chat/prompt input (e.g., "Refactor this Python code to be more efficient," "Explain this function," "Write a test case for this.").
    *   Codify will provide a summary, suggested changes (with diffs), and necessary commands.
*   **Vision Mode:**
    *   Click the "Start Screen Analysis" button.
    *   Codify will stream your screen to Gemini and give you spoken and text feedback.
    *   Click "Stop Screen Analysis" when done.
*   **Terminal:**
    *   Type commands in the terminal input (e.g., `python my_script.py`, `pip install <package>`).
    *   View real-time output. For long-running server commands, you'll see an option to stop them.
*   **Git Integration:**
    *   Access Git features through the dedicated "Git" tab or section.
    *   View status, stage files, commit, push, manage branches, and view history.
*   **Talk Live:**
    *   Use the "Talk Live" feature to have a spoken conversation with the AI.
